This project explores the transcriptional profile of parasitic 'Candidatus' Aquarickettsia rohweri within Acropora cervicornis tissue in a eutrohpication experiment. This experiment took place in the spring of 2019 at Mote's ICCRR. Gene expression data was generated by generating and sequencing cDNA libraries using Illumina HiSeq 3000 technology.
